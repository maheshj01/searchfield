#### [1.2.0] - November 28, 2024

- [Breaking]: Handle selected Value on Client Side [Issue: #191](https://github.com/maheshj01/searchfield/issues/191)

**Before**

The package sets the selectedValue automatically inside the component, which leads to issues when navigating or selecting suggestions

```dart
SearchField(
    hint: 'Basic SearchField',
    dynamicHeight: true,
    maxSuggestionBoxHeight: 300,
    initialValue: SearchFieldListItem<String>('ABC'),
    suggestions: dynamicHeightSuggestion
        .map(SearchFieldListItem<String>.new)
        .toList(),
    suggestionState: Suggestion.expand,
),
```

**After**

Now the client should handle the selectedValue explicitly in the client code (consumer code) by using the onSuggestionTap callback. This approach simplifies the API and provides more accurate control over the internal state of the package.

```dart
var selectedValue = SearchFieldListItem<String>('ABC');

SearchField(
    hint: 'Basic SearchField',
    dynamicHeight: true,
    maxSuggestionBoxHeight: 300,
    // now the selectedValue is handled by the client
    onSuggestionTap: (SearchFieldListItem<String> item) {
        setState(() {
            selectedValue = item;
        });
    },
    selectedValue: selectedValue, // rename initialValue to selectedValue
    suggestions: dynamicHeightSuggestion
        .map(SearchFieldListItem<String>.new)
        .toList(),
    suggestionState: Suggestion.expand,
),
```

- Fixes: [Issue: #178](https://github.com/maheshj01/searchfield/issues/178), [Issue: #155](https://github.com/maheshj01/searchfield/issues/155)

- Fixes: [Issue: #151](https://github.com/maheshj01/searchfield/issues/151) Clarifies use of SuggestionAction and now defaults to `SuggestionState.unfocus` without having to use `FocusNode` on client side.

- Fixes: [Issue: #190](https://github.com/maheshj01/searchfield/issues/190) Keyboard navigation does not work after selecting a suggestion.
